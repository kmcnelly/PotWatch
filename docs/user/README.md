Assume a non-technical person would like to use your project. What do they need to know to get started and to use specific features? (You can omit initial setup)
To the User:
Thank you for purchasing the potWatch cooking-aid. After the initial setup, the potWatch is designed to be a straight forward and repetitive process that may assist you in any water-based cooking with ease.

The potWatch is programmed with 4 stages of cooking which it loops through, pausing in between states ONLY when the target temperature and/or the target time set for that stage is completed.
Idle – The first stage
  This stage is the initial stage when the device is first turned on always and is a standby stage to indicate the device is ready to be used.

Prep – The second stage
  The prep stage is mainly designed for actions like boiling water in preparation to cook, in which the user may only care about being notified when the water is hot enough to start cooking.

Cooking – The third stage
  The cooking stage is the primary use for the potWatch in which the user may leave the kitchen and be notified several minutes before the food is done cooking via the webpage or push notifications

Cooling - The final stage
  The cooling stage is really an option stage meant to keep track of the temperature of the pot after use and indicate when the pot is a cool enough temperature/has soaked long enough to start cleaning.

USER GUIDE:
At the completion of each state, the device default begins on the completion of the idle state, the user must enter the target parameters for the next stage. Either the new temperature, the new length of time, or both must be achieved in order for the stage to be complete. In the case of both, both requirements must be fulfilled in order for the device to continue to the next step. The continue button online and the embedded buttons are a user confirmation of the starting of the next stage and will only be capable of transitioning once a new target time and/or new target temp is set. To skip a stage, the user can set the timer to 0 and/or temperature to an easily achievable temperature, like a few degrees above room temp. 

The indicator light will signal the completion of a stage.
